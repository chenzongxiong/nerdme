"# An Empirical Framework for Domain Generalization In Clinical Settings  ## Paper If you use this code in your research, please cite the following publication: ``` @inproceedings{zhang2021empirical,   title={An empirical framework for domain generalization in clinical settings},   author={Zhang, Haoran and Dullerud, Natalie and Seyyed-Kalantari, Laleh and Morris, Quaid and Joshi, Shalmali and Ghassemi, Marzyeh},   booktitle={Proceedings of the Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning},   pages={279--290},   year={2021} } ```  This paper can also be found on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11163    ## Acknowledgements  Our implementation is a modified version of the excellent [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed) framework (from commit [a10458a](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed/tree/a10458a2adfd8aec0fda2d617f710e5044e5dc60)).",DomainBed,PROJECT
"We also make use of some code from [eICU Benchmarks](https://github.com/mostafaalishahi/eICU_Benchmark).   ## To replicate the experiments in the paper:  ### Step 0: Environment and Prerequisites Run the following commands to clone this repo and create the Conda environment:  ``` git clone https://github.com/MLforHealth/ClinicalDG.git cd ClinicalDG/ conda env create -f environment.yml conda activate clinicaldg ```  ### Step 1: Obtaining the Data See [DataSources.md](DataSources.md) for detailed instructions.  ### Step 2: Running Experiments  Experiments can be ran using the same procedure as for the [DomainBed framework](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed), with a few additional adjustable data hyperparameters which should be passed in as a JSON formatted dictionary.",MLforHealth,PROJECT

"To this end, we propose a new task, panoramic audiovisual salient object detection (PAV-SOD), which aims to segment the objects grasping most of the human attention in 360° panoramic videos reflecting real-life daily scenes.",PAV-SOD,PROJECT
"To support the task, we collect PAVS10K, the first panoramic video dataset for audiovisual salient object detection, which consists of 67 4K-resolution equirectangular videos with per-video labels including hierarchical scene categories and associated attributes depicting specific challenges for conducting PAV-SOD, and 10,465 uniformly sampled video frames with manually annotated object-level and instance-level pixel-wise masks.",PAV-SOD,PROJECT
"With extensive experimental results, we gain several findings about PAV-SOD challenges and insights towards PAV-SOD model interpretability.",PAV-SOD,PROJECT
