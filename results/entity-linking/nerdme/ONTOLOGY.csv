"All these types can be extracted either considering rests or not.   ### Harmonic Features  For harmonic features, we implemented an algorithm to extract several harmonic features, including: * the pitch of the song * the dissonances present in the song * the chords that are formed in polyphonic compositions * the recurrent harmonic sequences, using a mirror approach to that proposed in the previous section.   ### Structural Features  For the structural features of the song, i.e. the structure and sections that make up the song, we reused the [MSAF library](https://pythonhosted.org/msaf/tutorial.html), using it directly on the audio signal.   ## HaMSE Ontology Starting from the lack of ontologies that deal with musicological research in an extensive way, we propose a novel ontological model.",HaMSE Ontology,ONTOLOGY
